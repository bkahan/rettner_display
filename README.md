## Main Display - Automated Display  

The slideshow is run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and updates periodically with current news, events, or other important information. 

## Expected Features: 

- Automatically remove old files if they are removed from the Google Drive folder
- Check for new files multiple times per day 
- Only show high-res images (relative to the display output) 


## Updates:

Update 12/14/19: Fixed the image rescaling issue.

Update 12/15/19: Integrated Google Drive API. Upon start up, the program searches for files to download in a given folder
